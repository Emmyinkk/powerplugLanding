            <h1>Buy electricity instantly, anytime.</h1>
            <p>My name is Oluwaseun; I work as a digital marketer at PowerPlug. 
                In less than two minutes, I want to show you how to buy electricity at your convenience, saving you time and stress.
                More often than not, you have bought electricity through the bank, and you didn't get it in time. It came very late. 
            </p>

                <p>The picture above is that of a customer I talked to earlier about powerplug, he called me at past 8 pm that in his compound, 
                    just like you, they have paid through the bank, but the token is taking forever to come. 
                    That night he used powerplug for the first time and has never looked back.
                </p>

                I also understand your other option is to dress up and leave your house to queue under the sun in front of a POS shop or at the 
                BEDC office.
                But what happens later at night or early in the morning??? Yes, you got it, 
                what you have always experienced in this condition - only you without light in your street.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you want to fix this? <span>Do you desire the freedom to pay your electricity bills anywhere and anytime?</span>
                Someone once asked me, "even at midnight?" The reply is yes. <span>You can buy electricity instantly at any time.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="bold">
                This is why powerplug exists, to give you freedom, help you to do things at your convenience, 
                you don't have to leave your house because you want to pay your electricity bills, 
                you do not have to queue under the sun to get your electricity tokens, 
                and you do not have to wait for days even hours before you get your token delivered to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also put the time you spend in a queue under the sun or at the BEDC office into other productive activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean, you are back from work tired and need to rest, then you realize you do not have light because your token is finished, 
                you were just about to prepare food to eat before you relax, and now you have to dash out to get token, 
                (you know if you order from your favorite bank, it will not come till the next day). You can save yourself the extra stress and time. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Please don't believe me; believe the words of those who have tried and have shared testimony.
